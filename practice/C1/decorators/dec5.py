# 5. Cashing Function Results
# Problem: Implement a decorator that caches the results 
# of a function call to avoid recomputation if the same 
# arguments are passed again. Test it with a function that
# squares a number.

# Expected Output:
# Computing square(4)
# Result: 16
# Using cached result for square(4)
# Result: 16
